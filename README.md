ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Joe Johnson, a passionate developer with a love for coding.

I've dabbled with many technical fields over the years ranging from game development to mobile application development. However, one field I always come back to is web development. I love experimenting with front-end and back-end work and have many projects displaying my knowledge in this area. I'm currently on the look out for a role as a junior developer, preferably full-stack but I'm open to other opportunities. If you're hiring, let's chat!
